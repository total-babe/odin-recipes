            <h3 id="active">Benefits of Gemstones</h3>
                <p>Gone are the days where only clairvoyants and hippies were privy to the insights and mystics of gemstones. Nowadays, the benefits of gemstones are widely recognized and acknowledged. 
                   One of the most powerful ways to experience the benefits of gemstones is by wearing them around your neck. With the variety of Malas available in our shop, achieving wellness has never been easier.</p>
                <h3 id="active">Connection</h3> 
                <p>Wearing one of our beautiful pieces connects you to the past. Historically, gemstones were used in a variety of ways. According to the author Maria Leach, in early times, gems were used to facilitate conception and induce love and hate.  Now, wearing gemstones is not affiliated with any particular culture or religion. Everyone can benefit from the beautiful gift of history and connection.</p> 
                <h3 id="active">Healing Powers</h3>
                <p>Each gemstone has unique healing powers. Every gem represents a planet and has the ability to draw energy from that planet and direct it to you. For example, red or pink ruby represents the sun. Just as the sun gives life to the natural world, ruby revitalizes and empowers the wearer to take responsibility and leadership in their life. Sounds too good to be true? It’s not! The energy of gemstones neutralizes the energetic blockages causing poor health and nourishes all aspects of your being.</p>
                <h3 id="active">Calming Weight</h3>
                <p>Handcrafted with 108 semi-precious gems, the weight of our Mala necklaces can have a calming effect on the wearer. In the bustle of our modern lifestyle, gemstones can help you to 'get your calm on', particularly if you choose Hematite, Blue Lace Agate, or Sandalwood stones, which relieve anxiety and stress and have a ‘grounding’ effect.</p>
